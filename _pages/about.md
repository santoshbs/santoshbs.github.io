Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Management & Human Resources Department at [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en). I received my PhD in Management from the [University of Texas at Austin's](https://www.utexas.edu/) [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/). My research focuses on social evaluations in organizational and entrepreneurial contexts. Towards this end, I take a cultural perspective and utilize quantitative methodological approaches. In much of my current research, I examine language use through computational linguistic analyses.
