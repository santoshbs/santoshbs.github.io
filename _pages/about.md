Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Management & Human Resources at HEC Paris. I received my PhD in Management from the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business. My research focuses on social evaluations in organizational and entrepreneurial contexts. Towards this end, I take a cultural perspective and adopt quantitative methodological approaches. In much of my current research, I examine language use through computational linguistic analyses.
