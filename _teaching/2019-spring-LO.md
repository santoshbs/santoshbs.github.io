This course seeks to enhance your understanding of the sociological and psychological aspects of organizational life. More specifically, we will explore three classic perspectives on organizations — strategic design, cultural, and political — to build an appreciation of critical issues involved in leading and managing at work. Each lens provides explanations of why some organizations flourish, and some leaders and managers succeed, whereas others fail to accomplish their goals. We will discuss leadership and managerial implications of each lens, and the tools to analyze and tackle organizational problems.
