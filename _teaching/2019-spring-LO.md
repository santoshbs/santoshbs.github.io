This course focuses on the sociological and psychological aspects of organizational life. It aims to build an appreciation and understanding of critical issues involved in leading and managing at work. Towards this end, the three classic perspectives on organizations — strategic design, cultural, and political — will be explored. Through each lens, why some organizations flourish, and some leaders and managers succeed, whereas others fail to accomplish their goals will be examined. The leadership and managerial implications of each lens, along with the tools to analyze and tackle organizational problems will be discussed.
